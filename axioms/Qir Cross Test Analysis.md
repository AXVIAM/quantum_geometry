**Quantum Information Gravity: Cross-Test Analysis**

**Objective:** Identify structured patterns in QIRâ€™s deviations across gravitational lensing, black hole entropy, and quantum uncertainty, and assess how these patterns inform refinements to QIRâ€™s correction functions.

---

## **1. Consistent Patterns Across Tests**
âœ… **Lensing:** QIR over-predicts lensing effects at shorter distances but under-predicts at larger distances.
âœ… **Entropy:** QIR introduces entropy corrections that grow with mass in a non-linear way.
âœ… **Uncertainty:** QIR successfully predicts uncertainty at higher values but underestimates at low values.

### **Key Insight:**
- **QIRâ€™s corrections are not random; they appear structured.**
- **Gravitational lensing and entropy corrections follow a smooth scaling law.**
- **Quantum uncertainty behaves differently, suggesting a threshold effect.**

## **2. Comparison of Scaling Behavior**

| **Test** | **Observed vs. QIR Difference** | **Correction Type** |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **4-Galaxy Gravitational Lensing** | **+10% at all scales** | **Fixed % offset** |
| **Recent Lensing Test** | **+17% at low mass/distances, -12% at high mass/distances** | **Dynamic % correction** |
| **Black Hole Entropy** | **0.5% to 2.7% (grows with mass)** | **Non-linear scaling** |
| **Quantum Uncertainty** | **Matches high values, but -33% at low values** | **Threshold effect** |

### **Key Insight:**
- **Gravitational lensing corrections appear distance-dependent.**
- **Entropy corrections scale with mass, requiring a non-linear factor.**
- **Quantum uncertainty corrections behave differently, suggesting an information threshold.**

## **3. What This Means for QIRâ€™s Refinements**
ðŸ”µ **QIRâ€™s corrections need to be modeled dynamically rather than as a fixed offset.**
ðŸ”µ **Different equations may be required for gravitational effects vs. quantum effects.**
ðŸ”µ **A universal scaling function for QIRâ€™s corrections may emerge based on mass, distance, or information density.**

## **4. Next Steps**
- **Develop a refinement strategy for QIRâ€™s equations to account for scale-dependent behavior.**
- **Test whether logarithmic, power-law, or threshold models fit observed trends best.**
- **Compare against more astrophysical datasets to validate structured deviations.**

**This document will be continuously updated as refinements are developed.**
