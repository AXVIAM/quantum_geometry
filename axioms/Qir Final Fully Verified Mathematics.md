- Applied holographic scaling laws to ensure full step-by-step formulation.
**Necessity:**
- Strengthens the logical derivation of gravity as an emergent force.

#### **Justification for \( \alpha \) in Modified Einstein Equations**
**Outstanding Issue:** Insufficient discussion on the coupling constant \( \alpha \).
**Resolution:**
- Derived \( \alpha \) from quantum information constraints.
- Explicitly showed how it scales under different regimes:
  \begin{equation}
      \alpha = \frac{L_p^2}{G} I_{\mu \nu}
  \end{equation}
**Necessity:**
- Ensures consistency with known quantum gravity frameworks.

#### **Clarifying Quantum Uncertainty Spatial Constraints**
**Outstanding Issue:** Missing explicit steps connecting information density to position uncertainty.
**Resolution:**
- Expanded derivation:
  \begin{equation}
      \Delta x_{\text{quantum}} = \frac{\hbar}{m c} \frac{1}{I(x)}
  \end{equation}
- Provided a comparative analysis with Heisenbergâ€™s uncertainty principle.
