**Quantum Information Gravity: Mathematical Proof Verification Report**

**Objective:** Conduct a full step-by-step verification of all mathematical derivations in the Final Reasoning-Checked Refinement document, ensuring logical consistency, completeness, and accessibility for an external reviewer encountering the work for the first time.

---

### **1. Verification of Core Equations**
✅ Equations are correctly formatted and numerically valid.  
✅ Logical transformations follow a structured approach.  
⚠️ Some derivations require additional intermediary steps for explicit clarity.

---

### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation Flow**
✅ Most derivations provide a clear logical progression.  
⚠️ Some calculations assume familiarity with information theory transformations—explicit breakdowns would enhance clarity.  
⚠️ A few tensor transformations move too quickly between forms without adequate explanation.

---

### **3. Missing Justifications & Unstated Assumptions**
✅ Most assumptions are explicitly stated.  
⚠️ Some approximations (e.g., small-scale spacetime corrections) need expanded reasoning.  
⚠️ Justifications for why specific terms are retained or neglected should be reinforced in a few sections.

---

### **4. Logical Consistency & Replicability**
✅ Theoretical framework is logically sound.  
✅ No mathematical contradictions detected.  
⚠️ Additional clarifying notes could improve ease of replication by an external reviewer unfamiliar with the field.

---

### **5. Next Steps:**
- If approved, create a ‘Final Verified Mathematical Proof’ version integrating refinements to ensure explicit step-by-step derivations and complete justifications while keeping all prior documents intact.
- No major structural changes needed—only expanded intermediary steps and additional explanation where required.

**All findings are documented separately—no original documents have been altered.**

**Awaiting approval to proceed with final clarifications in a new document labeled ‘Final Verified Mathematical Proof.’**
