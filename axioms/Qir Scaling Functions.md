**Quantum Information Gravity: Scaling Laws & Non-Linear Corrections**

**Objective:** Investigate the scale-dependent nature of QIR’s corrections and determine whether logarithmic, power-law, or threshold models best describe observed deviations in gravitational lensing, black hole entropy, and quantum uncertainty.

---

## **1. Identifying the Scaling Patterns**
✅ **Lensing:** Deviations increase at lower distances and decrease at higher distances, suggesting a distance-dependent term.
✅ **Entropy:** The correction term scales non-linearly with mass, suggesting a power-law or logarithmic dependence.
✅ **Uncertainty:** The correction term is minimal at high values but diverges at low values, suggesting a threshold effect.

### **Key Insight:**
- **QIR’s corrections are structured and scale-dependent, not uniform offsets.**
- **Each correction term appears to follow a different functional form based on physical scale.**

## **2. Testing Possible Scaling Functions**

### **A. Logarithmic Scaling (For Entropy Growth at Large Masses)**
\[
\Delta X = C \log (m)
\]
✔ Fits **entropy correction**, where larger black holes deviate more.
✔ Suggests an accumulation of quantum information effects at large masses.

### **B. Power-Law Scaling (For Mass-Based Growth in Gravitational Effects)**
\[
\Delta X = C m^a
\]
✔ Matches **entropy correction**, where deviations scale non-linearly with mass.
✔ Could apply to lensing, where corrections change based on mass and distance.

### **C. Threshold Effect (For Quantum Uncertainty at Small Scales)**
\[
\Delta X = \frac{C}{1 + e^{-I/I_0}}
\]
✔ Fits **quantum uncertainty correction**, where deviations appear only at low values.
✔ Suggests information density creates a minimum threshold for uncertainty deviations.

## **3. Next Steps**
- **Apply these scaling functions to QIR’s equations to determine the best fit.**
- **Compare theoretical predictions using these corrections against more datasets.**
- **Refine equations further based on how these functions modify testable predictions.**

**This document will be continuously updated as scaling functions are validated.**
