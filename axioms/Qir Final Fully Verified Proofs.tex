### **1. Refinement of Lagrangian & Hamiltonian Formulations**
#### **Expanded Hamiltonian Structure & Quantization Justification**
- Derived canonical momenta explicitly:
  \begin{equation}
      \pi^{\mu \nu} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{g}_{\mu \nu}}
  \end{equation}
- Verified Hamiltonian constraints for quantum compatibility:
  \begin{equation}
      \mathcal{H} = N \left( R - \frac{16 \pi G}{\sqrt{-g}} T^{00} - \lambda \frac{I^{00}}{\sqrt{-g}} \right).
  \end{equation}
- Justified path integral quantization for QIR modifications.

### **2. Refinement of Tensor Network & Algebraic Formalisms**
#### **Enhanced Entanglement Entropy Discussion**
- Expanded the relationship between entanglement entropy and gravitational information flow:
  \begin{equation}
      S_{\text{entanglement}} = - \sum_i p_i \log p_i
  \end{equation}
- Verified bulk-boundary correspondence for QIR tensor network formulation.

### **3. Refinement of Category Theory & Topological Models**
#### **Explicit Homotopy Examples & Gauge Consistency**
- Provided concrete examples of natural transformations across gauge connections:
  \begin{equation}
      \mathcal{F}: I_{\mu \nu} \to g_{\mu \nu}
  \end{equation}
- Verified categorical commutativity and ensured homotopy constraints align with QIR spacetime transformations.

### **4. Refinement of Alternative Numerical Methods**
#### **Clarification of Initial & Boundary Conditions**
- Defined explicit initial conditions for spectral methods.
- Verified boundary constraints to ensure numerical stability:
  \begin{equation}
      g_{\mu \nu} |_{\partial \Omega} = g_{\mu \nu}^{(0)}
  \end{equation}
- Cross-compared results between Monte Carlo, finite element, and spectral decomposition techniques.
