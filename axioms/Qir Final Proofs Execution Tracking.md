### **1. Verification of Integrated Refinements in Each Proof Document**

#### **Proof of Lagrangian & Hamiltonian Formulations**
✅ Lagrangian density is correctly derived and follows from information-based corrections.  
✅ Euler-Lagrange formalism properly leads to modified Einstein equations.  
✅ Hamiltonian formulation includes explicit derivations of canonical momenta and constraints.  
✅ Path integral quantization for QIR modifications is fully justified.  

#### **Proof of Tensor Network & Algebraic Formalisms**
✅ Tensor contractions and network representations align with quantum information scaling.  
✅ Algebraic structures maintain logical consistency with QIR entropy-based corrections.  
✅ Entanglement entropy role is now explicitly stated and justified.  
✅ Mapping between tensor spaces and bulk curvature fully expanded.  

#### **Proof of Category Theory & Topological Models**
✅ The category-theoretic approach is correctly formulated with functorial mappings.  
✅ Topological fiber bundle structure aligns with QIR modifications.  
✅ Additional examples of natural transformations are provided to confirm gauge consistency.  
✅ Homotopy properties are explicitly worked through for formal correctness.  

#### **Proof of Alternative Numerical Methods**
✅ Spectral and finite element methods successfully applied to QIR-modified equations.  
✅ Cross-validation confirms stability of solutions across multiple computational techniques.  
✅ Initial conditions for spectral methods are clearly documented.  
✅ Boundary conditions compared across Monte Carlo and alternative numerical methods.

### **3. Next Steps for Final Compilation**
1️⃣ **Mark all verified proofs as final.**  
2️⃣ **Ensure proof documents are ready for external validation and submission.**  
3️⃣ **Prepare the final structured document integrating all proofs into a unified framework.**
