### **3. Next Steps for Final Execution**  
1️⃣ **Complete pending mathematical derivations for documents still requiring execution.**  
2️⃣ **Ensure boundary conditions and extreme-case applications are fully validated.**  
3️⃣ **Finalize interdisciplinary application proofs with computational models.**  
4️⃣ **Mark documents as completed once all refinements are executed and verified.**
