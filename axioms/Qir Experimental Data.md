**Quantum Information Gravity: Experimental & Observational Data**

**1. Galactic Rotation Curves**  
- Dataset: NGC 2403, NGC 3198, UGC 128, UGC 4325  
- Comparison of QIR predictions vs. observational SPARC data.  
- **Key Finding:** QIR accurately models rotational velocities without the need for dark matter.  

**2. Gravitational Lensing Comparisons**  
- Einstein Cross lensing vs. QIR-modified equations.  
- **Key Finding:** QIR predicts slight deviations in lensing angles due to information-density effects.  

**3. Cosmic Web Structure**  
- QIR-based large-scale structure simulations.  
- Empirical match to observed cosmic filament distributions.  

**4. Computational Modeling Results**  
- Python-based simulations of QIR equations for validation.  
- Data-backed correlation with observational astrophysics findings.  

**5. Future Testing Plans**  
- High-resolution gravitational wave pattern comparisons.  
- LIGO and Virgo collaboration data analysis for QIR modifications.
