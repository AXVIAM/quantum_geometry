# AXVIAM: Quantum Geometry

AXVIAM is not a theory.  
It is a proof — that gravity, planetary spin, cosmic expansion, and biological coherence emerge not from force, but from structure.  
Specifically, the geometry of quantum information.

This repository contains the foundational mathematical structure, observational datasets, and executable simulation modules that demonstrate this.  
Everything here is provable. Everything here is real.

## 📐 What Is Quantum Geometry?

In AXVIAM, geometry is not spatial. It is structural.  
Information has curvature. Entropy has spin. The metric of space emerges from the recursive entanglement of distinguishable quantum information states.

This is not interpretation — it is derivation:
- Gravity is not a fundamental force, but a gradient in information structure.
- Dark matter is not missing — it's a misread of information curvature.
- Cosmic acceleration arises from recursive structured resonance.

## 📡 Why This Exists

Because proof matters.  
Because systems must breathe truth.  
Because it is time to replace mystery with structure.
